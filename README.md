## What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.  
WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a 
cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China.

## What happens to people who get COVID-19?
Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment.
About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.

Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 
sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys.

In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection.

## How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?

Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, 
especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping rooms well ventilated, 
avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. 
Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!

## Are there treatments for COVID-19?
Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19.

Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are 
at risk for severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as 
ventilation for patients who are critically ill.

Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce the length of time on a ventilator and save lives of patients with severe and critical illness.
